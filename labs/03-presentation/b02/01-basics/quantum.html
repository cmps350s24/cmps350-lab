    <h1>Quantum computing</h1>
    <p>
      A <strong>quantum computer</strong> is a computer that exploits quantum
      mechanical phenomena. At small scales, physical matter exhibits
      properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages
      this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot
      explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum
      computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any
      modern “classical” computer. In particular, a large-scale quantum
      computer could break widely-used encryption schemes and aid physicists
      in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the
      art is still largely experimental and impractical.

    <p>
      The basic unit of information in quantum computing is the qubit, similar
      to the bit in traditional digital electronics. Unlike a classical bit, a
      qubit can exist in a superposition of its two “basis” states, which
      loosely means that it is in both states simultaneously. When measuring a
      qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a
      quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave
      interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The
      design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a
      quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a
      physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it
      suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations.
      National governments have invested heavily in experimental research that
      aims to develop scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower
      error rates. Two of the most promising technologies are superconductors
      (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical
      resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using
      electromagnetic fields).
    </p>
    <p>
      Any computational problem that can be solved by a classical computer can
      also be solved by a quantum computer. Conversely, any problem that can
      be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a classical
      computer, at least in principle given enough time. In other words,
      quantum computers obey the Church-Turing thesis. This means that while
      quantum computers provide no additional advantages over classical
      computers in terms of computability, quantum algorithms for certain
      problems have significantly lower time complexities than corresponding
      known classical algorithms. Notably, quantum computers are believed to
      be able to quickly solve certain problems that no classical computer
      could solve in any feasible amount of time—a feat known as “quantum
      supremacy.” The study of the computational complexity of problems with
      respect to quantum computers is known as quantum complexity theory.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        For many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science
        formed distinct academic communities. Modern quantum theory developed
        in the 1920s to explain the wave-particle duality observed at atomic
        scales, and digital computers emerged in the following decades to
        replace human computers for tedious calculations. Both disciplines had
        practical applications during World War II; computers played a major
        role in wartime cryptography, and quantum physics was essential for
        the nuclear physics used in the Manhattan Project.
      </p>
      <p>
        As physicists applied quantum mechanical models to computational
        problems and swapped digital bits for qubits, the fields of quantum
        mechanics and computer science began to converge. In 1980, Paul
        Benioff introduced the quantum Turing machine, which uses quantum
        theory to describe a simplified computer. When digital computers
        became faster, physicists faced an exponential increase in overhead
        when simulating quantum dynamics, prompting Yuri Manin and Richard
        Feynman to independently suggest that hardware based on quantum
        phenomena might be more efficient for computer simulation. In a 1984
        paper, Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard applied quantum theory to
        cryptography protocols and demonstrated that quantum key distribution
        could enhance information security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quantum algorithms then emerged for solving oracle problems, such as
        Deutsch's algorithm in 1985, the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm in 1993,
        and Simon's algorithm in 1994. These algorithms did not solve
        practical problems, but demonstrated mathematically that one could
        gain more information by querying a black box in superposition,
        sometimes referred to as quantum parallelism. Peter Shor built on
        these results with his 1994 algorithms for breaking the widely-used
        RSA and Diffie-Hellman encryption protocols, which drew significant
        attention to the field of quantum computing. In 1996, Grover's
        algorithm established a quantum speedup for the widely-applicable
        unstructured search problem. The same year, Seth Lloyd proved that
        quantum computers could simulate quantum systems without the
        exponential overhead present in classical simulations, validating
        Feynman's 1982 conjecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        The threshold theorem shows how increasing the number of qubits can
        mitigate errors, yet fully fault-tolerant quantum computing remains “a
        rather distant dream”. According to some researchers, noisy
        intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) machines may have specialized uses
        in the near future, but noise in quantum gates limits their
        reliability. In recent years, investment in quantum computing research
        has increased in the public and private sectors. As one consulting
        firm summarized,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          ... investment dollars are pouring in, and quantum-computing
          start-ups are proliferating. ... While quantum computing promises to
          help businesses solve problems that are beyond the reach and speed
          of conventional high-performance computers, use cases are largely
          experimental and hypothetical at this early stage.

      <h2>Algorithms</h2>
      <p>
        Progress in finding quantum algorithms typically focuses on this
        quantum circuit model, though exceptions like the quantum adiabatic
        algorithm exist. Quantum algorithms can be roughly categorized by the
        type of speedup achieved over corresponding classical algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quantum algorithms that offer more than a polynomial speedup over the
        best-known classical algorithm include Shor's algorithm for factoring
        and the related quantum algorithms for computing discrete logarithms,
        solving Pell's equation, and more generally solving the hidden
        subgroup problem for abelian finite groups. These algorithms depend on
        the primitive of the quantum Fourier transform. No mathematical proof
        has been found that shows that an equally fast classical algorithm
        cannot be discovered, although this is considered unlikely. Certain
        oracle problems like Simon's problem and the Bernstein–Vazirani
        problem do give provable speedups, though this is in the quantum query
        model, which is a restricted model where lower bounds are much easier
        to prove and doesn't necessarily translate to speedups for practical
        problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other problems, including the simulation of quantum physical processes
        from chemistry and solid-state physics, the approximation of certain
        Jones polynomials, and the quantum algorithm for linear systems of
        equations have quantum algorithms appearing to give super-polynomial
        speedups and are BQP-complete. Because these problems are
        BQP-complete, an equally fast classical algorithm for them would imply
        that no quantum algorithm gives a super-polynomial speedup, which is
        believed to be unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some quantum algorithms, like Grover's algorithm and amplitude
        amplification, give polynomial speedups over corresponding classical
        algorithms. Though these algorithms give comparably modest quadratic
        speedup, they are widely applicable and thus give speedups for a wide
        range of problems. Many examples of provable quantum speedups for
        query problems are related to Grover's algorithm, including Brassard,
        Høyer, and Tapp's algorithm for finding collisions in two-to-one
        functions, which uses Grover's algorithm, and Farhi, Goldstone, and
        Gutmann's algorithm for evaluating NAND trees, which is a variant of
        the search problem.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          There are a number of technical challenges in building a large-scale
          quantum computer. Physicist David DiVincenzo has listed these
          requirements for a practical quantum computer:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Physically scalable to increase the number of qubits</li>
          <li>Qubits that can be initialized to arbitrary values</li>
          <li>Quantum gates that are faster than decoherence time</li>
          <li>Universal gate set</li>
          <li>Qubits that can be read easily</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Sourcing parts for quantum computers is also very difficult.
          Superconducting quantum computers, like those constructed by Google
          and IBM, need helium-3, a nuclear research byproduct, and special
          superconducting cables made only by the Japanese company Coax Co.
        </p>
        <p>
          The control of multi-qubit systems requires the generation and
          coordination of a large number of electrical signals with tight and
          deterministic timing resolution. This has led to the development of
          quantum controllers which enable interfacing with the qubits.
          Scaling these systems to support a growing number of qubits is an
          additional challenge.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>Decoherence</h4>
          <p>
            One of the greatest challenges involved with constructing quantum
            computers is controlling or removing quantum decoherence. This
            usually means isolating the system from its environment as
            interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere.
            However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include
            the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background
            thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the
            qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively
            non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly
            controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate
            systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time T2 (for NMR
            and MRI technology, also called the dephasing time), typically
            range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature.
            Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be
            cooled to 20 millikelvin (usually using a dilution refrigerator)
            in order to prevent significant decoherence. A 2020 study argues
            that ionizing radiation such as cosmic rays can nevertheless cause
            certain systems to decohere within milliseconds.

        <h3>Quantum supremacy</h3>
        <p>
          Quantum supremacy is a term coined by John Preskill referring to the
          engineering feat of demonstrating that a programmable quantum device
          can solve a problem beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art
          classical computers. The problem need not be useful, so some view
          the quantum supremacy test only as a potential future benchmark.

      <section>
        <h3>Skepticism</h3>
        <p>
          Some researchers have expressed skepticism that scalable quantum
          computers could ever be built, typically because of the issue of
          maintaining coherence at large scales, but also for other reasons.

      <section>
        <h3>Computability</h3>
        <p>
          Any computational problem solvable by a classical computer is also
          solvable by a quantum computer. Intuitively, this is because it is
          believed that all physical phenomena, including the operation of
          classical computers, can be described using quantum mechanics, which
          underlies the operation of quantum computers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, any problem solvable by a quantum computer is also
          solvable by a classical computer. It is possible to simulate both
          quantum and classical computers manually with just some paper and a
          pen, if given enough time. More formally, any quantum computer can
          be simulated by a Turing machine. In other words, quantum computers
          provide no additional power over classical computers in terms of
          computability. This means that quantum computers cannot solve
          undecidable problems like the halting problem and the existence of
          quantum computers does not disprove the Church-Turing thesis.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Complexity</h3>
        <p>
          While quantum computers cannot solve any problems that classical
          computers cannot already solve, it is suspected that they can solve
          certain problems faster than classical computers. For instance, it
          is known that quantum computers can efficiently factor integers,
          while this is not believed to be the case for classical computers.
