    <h1>Qubit</h1>
    <p>
      In quantum computing, a <strong>qubit</strong> (/ˈkjuːbɪt/) or quantum
      bit is a basic unit of quantum information—the quantum version of the
      classic binary bit physically realized with a two-state device. A qubit
      is a two-state (or two-level) quantum-mechanical system, one of the
      simplest quantum systems displaying the peculiarity of quantum
      mechanics. Examples include the spin of the electron in which the two
      levels can be taken as spin up and spin down; or the polarization of a
      single photon in which the two states can be taken to be the vertical
      polarization and the horizontal polarization. In a classical system, a
      bit would have to be in one state or the other. However, quantum
      mechanics allows the qubit to be in a coherent superposition of both
      states simultaneously, a property that is fundamental to quantum
      mechanics and quantum computing.

      <h2>Etymology</h2>
      <p>
        The coining of the term qubit is attributed to Benjamin Schumacher. In
        the acknowledgments of his 1995 paper, Schumacher states that the term
        qubit was created in jest during a conversation with William Wootters.

      <h2>Bit versus qubit</h2>
      <p>
        A binary digit, characterized as 0 or 1, is used to represent
        information in classical computers. When averaged over both of its
        states (0, 1), a binary digit can represent up to one bit of Shannon
        information, where a bit is the basic unit of information. However, in
        this article, the word bit is synonymous with a binary digit.
      </p>
      <p>
        In classical computer technologies, a processed bit is implemented by
        one of two levels of low DC voltage, and whilst switching from one of
        these two levels to the other, a so-called “forbidden zone” between
        two logic levels must be passed as fast as possible, as electrical
        voltage cannot change from one level to another instantaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two possible outcomes for the measurement of a qubit—usually
        taken to have the value “0” and “1”, like a bit or binary digit.
        However, whereas the state of a bit can only be either 0 or 1, the
        general state of a qubit according to quantum mechanics can be a
        coherent superposition of both. Moreover, whereas a measurement of a
        classical bit would not disturb its state, a measurement of a qubit
        would destroy its coherence and irrevocably disturb the superposition
        state. It is possible to fully encode one bit in one qubit. However, a
        qubit can hold more information, e.g., up to two bits using superdense
        coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a system of n components, a complete description of its state in
        classical physics requires only n bits, whereas in quantum physics it
        requires 2n complex numbers (or a single point in a 2n-dimensional
        vector space).

      <h2>Quantum register</h2>
      <p>
        A number of qubits taken together is a qubit register. Quantum
        computers perform calculations by manipulating qubits within a
        register.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Qudits and qutrits</h3>
        <p>
          The term qudit denotes the unit of quantum information that can be
          realized in suitable d-level quantum systems. A qubit register that
          can be measured to N states is identical to an N-level qudit. A
          rarely used synonym for qudit is quNit, since both d and N are
          frequently used to denote the dimension of a quantum system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Qudits are similar to the integer types in classical computing, and
          may be mapped to (or realized by) arrays of qubits. Qudits where the
          d-level system is not an exponent of 2 can not be mapped to arrays
          of qubits. It is for example possible to have 5-level qudits.

      <h2>Qubit storage</h2>
      <p>
        In 2008 a team of scientists from the U.K. and U.S. reported the first
        relatively long (1.75 seconds) and coherent transfer of a
        superposition state in an electron spin “processing” qubit to a
        nuclear spin “memory” qubit. This event can be considered the first
        relatively consistent quantum data storage, a vital step towards the
        development of quantum computing. In 2013, a modification of similar
        systems (using charged rather than neutral donors) has dramatically
        extended this time, to 3 hours at very low temperatures and 39 minutes
        at room temperature. Room temperature preparation of a qubit based on
        electron spins instead of nuclear spin was also demonstrated by a team
        of scientists from Switzerland and Australia. An increased coherence
        of qubits is being explored by researchers who are testing the
        limitations of a Ge hole spin-orbit qubit structure.
